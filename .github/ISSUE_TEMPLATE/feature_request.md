**Please describe your feature request in a couple sentences**
I want sellstick to be able to hook into my brain so that when I think of shmkane, it'll sell things for me.
**Please describe your feature request in a couple of user stories**
As a user I want to be able to sell my items using brain waves so that I can keep being lazy



Example: As an admin, I want to be able to change the prices of items so that I don't have to go into a config file.
Example: As a player, I want to be able to punch cows and have them drop meat so that I can live
